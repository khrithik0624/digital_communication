The transmission of a QPSK signal was simulated over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel using
both Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-
CDMA) techniques. The respective Bit Error Rate (BER) performances of these techniques were then compared.
At the receiver, the Zero Forcing Error technique was employed for symbol detection.
